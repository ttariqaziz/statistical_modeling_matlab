# statistical_modeling_matlab
Highlights of my research work in MATLAB, statistical modeling of the unstructured raw data from GPS satellites for several years. Data modeling and processing, followed by different residual plots including trends and root mean square. In the end, the result was compared with independent data set models for validation purposes.
The results were also presented at a European conference.
